## 1. Open Source Contributions

### Product Owner - Product Manager(ALC Open Source Community)

I am building a Product called Mentor Management System for ALC Open Source Community.
As a Product Owner, I managed team of 7 designers to design the first phase of the product from scatch. I coordinated a cross-fuctional team(10) made up of 136 Google Africa Developers Scholarship(GADS) learners to built the Android version of the Mentor Management System app during the GADS 2022 project Phase.
Presently, I am coordinating a cross-fuctional team(7) of 50 Engineers developing the Web Application of the Mentor Management System for ALC Open Source Program Cohort 2. Also leading 22 designers who are redesigning the Mobile Application.
